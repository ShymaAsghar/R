Welcome!
This was a project created by my team at Boot camp using Data from Kaggle. 
The steps we took were: 
1) importing data and libraries into R, 
2) Editing  column data types to match and quering to check for missing values. 
3) Basic stastical analyses
4) creating histograms, scattergraphs and box plots.
5) summarising findings and suggesting recommendations.
